  <string name="about_long"><![CDATA[<p>Android AntiForensic Tools is a free and open-source app designed to protect your personal data from a powerful adversary who can put pressure on you and force you to unlock your device. It allows you to delete user profiles and personal files when a fake password is entered, a USB device connected or the wrong password is entered several times. An app provides additional options to protect your device from being researched by advanced adversaries: it can uninstall itself, run TRIM after data deletion to prevent deleted data recovery, disable logs before data deletion to leave no traces of it\'s actions and disable safe boot mode.</p><p>Read more on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/bakad3v/Android-AntiForensic-Tools">GitHub</a>.</p><p>You can support me with Monero: 88Z5fsVK6FP4oVNjo2BrHydAEa5Y1gTPi5d7BN68sjVDZ9dTn8wPb89WmUxrxf3T37bRGSR5dekkU9aQ7j8ErWcBJ2GZojC</p><p>Special thanks to:</p><p>x13a, the developer of the Wasted app which inspired me to create this app.</p><p>iamr0s, the developer of the Dhizuku application. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>BinTianqi, the developer of the Owndroid app, who wrote the code to connect to the Dhizuku service.</p>]]></string>

Self-destruction may take several seconds, so try to not provide correct password too fast. Important: android apps leave numerous traces on android system even after uninstallation. This problem can be partially solved by changing the package name of the application. You can find instructions on how to change the package name for this app and a link to the version of the app with the changed package name on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/bakad3v/Android-AntiForensic-Tools">GitHub</a>.</li><li>Use all triggers (duress password, USB connection, bruteforce).

Running TRIM after data deletion may reduce the likelihood of deleted data recovery.</li><li>Disable logd. Adversary may use log data to get the history of Android AntiForensic Tools actions.
