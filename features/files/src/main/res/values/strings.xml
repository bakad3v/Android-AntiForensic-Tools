If you enter the duress password in BFU mode, file deletion will start after the phone is unlocked. If you set up the app to destroy itself, it will do so only after all files have been deleted. That’s why it is recommended to avoid using this mode and instead delete the profile with your secret files if you can grant the app enough privileges.</strong></p>]]></string>
