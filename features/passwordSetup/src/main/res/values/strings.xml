<p>This password will be used both to unlock the application and to trigger data deletion. If you configure the app properly, entering this password on the lock screen will perform the destructive actions you specify. Here are some tips:</p>

Some firmware enforces different rules, so these restrictions cannot always be applied programmatically — you need to test them on your device.</p>
<p>• Choose a password similar to your device password. If the passwords are similar, an adversary is more likely to believe you entered the wrong password by mistake.</p>
