Without root, the possibilities of an app would be limited, though some advanced functions are available with Dhizuku. You can set up an app to wipe the whole device, or to delete some user data and hide itself from the launcher.</p><p>• If, alternatively, you are only wary of having your device searched and in your situation an obvious deletion of data from your device could put you in danger, then grant the app root privileges. In that case, I advise you to set up deletion of your secondary user profile and enable all possible options: stop logd, run TRIM, uninstall itself. The app will stop logd, delete your profile, start TRIM to make data unrecoverable and finally uninstall itself. Complete self-destruction may take several seconds, so try to not provide the correct password to an adversary too fast.</p><p><strong>Follow the tips listed below regardless of the threat model!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>• Use all triggers (duress password, USB connection, bruteforce, power button). Data destruction will start on activation of one of these triggers. Each of them protects you from different types of attacks.</p><p>• Disable safe boot mode or make this app a system app if you can. Safe boot mode may be used to circumvent the protection offered by this app. However, disabling safe boot mode may raise suspicions.</p><p>• If you set up this app to delete data in the specified user profile, disable UI for switching between users when you doesn\'t need it, because otherwise an adversary may use the pull-down settings menu to get a list of your profiles from the lockscreen.</p><p>• If you set up this app to delete data in the specified user profile, install this app in this user profile too and set up an app to wipe data on all triggers.</p><p>• Make sure the app is working and data deletion with app uninstallation doesn\'t take too long. You can use logs to do some tests. Test before use! Test after updating the app! If something is wrong, please create an issue on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/bakad3v/Android-AntiForensic-Tools">GitHub</a> and show logs.
